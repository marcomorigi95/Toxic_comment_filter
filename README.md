# Toxic Comment Classification with Deep Learning

## Problem Overview

With the rise of user-generated content, **online platforms are struggling to manage toxic, offensive, or threatening comments**. Manual moderation is both expensive and slow, while real-time filtering is essential to maintaining a safe and respectful community environment.

This project offers an **automated content moderation solution** using **deep learning** to classify toxic comments in real time. The aim is to **improve the quality of online discussions** by filtering out harmful content and creating a **safe, inclusive experience** for all users.

---

## Objectives

* Automatically classify **toxic comments** (e.g., obscene, threat, insult).
* Improve **moderation efficiency** using **state-of-the-art deep learning**.
* Support real-time filtering without harming user experience.
* Explore the impact of **pre-trained embeddings** and **data augmentation** techniques on model performance.

---

## Workflow Overview

The project follows these key steps:

### 1. Dataset Analysis & EDA

* Analyze the raw dataset structure
* Explore class imbalance and comment distributions
* Visualize frequent toxic terms and clean text patterns

### 2. Text Preprocessing

* Tokenization
* Lowercasing
* Punctuation and stopword removal
* Padding and truncation for neural networks

### 3. Baseline Model

* A simple **benchmark model** is built (e.g., logistic regression or simple dense neural net) to establish a reference performance.

### 4. Deep Learning Models

Implemented models include:

* `Dense Neural Network`
* `GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)`
* `LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)`

All models are trained and evaluated using cleaned comment data.

---

### 4.1 Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision / Recall**
* **F1-score**
* **Confusion Matrix**
* ROC-AUC (for binary classification, if applicable)

---


### 5. Data Augmentation

* Use techniques such as synonym replacement, back translation, and random insertion to generate more robust training samples.

### 6. Pre-trained Embeddings

* Evaluate the effect of **FastText** and **GloVe** embeddings on model performance.

### 7. Final Testing

* Compare all models on a held-out test set.
* Evaluate metrics like **accuracy**, **F1-score**, **precision**, and **recall**.

### 8. ðŸ“Œ Conclusions

* Discuss findings, trade-offs, and recommend the best model for production deployment.

##  Example Use Case

Platforms like forums, comment sections, and social networks can integrate this solution to:

* Automatically flag harmful content
* Reduce manual moderation effort
* Improve user safety and platform integrity
